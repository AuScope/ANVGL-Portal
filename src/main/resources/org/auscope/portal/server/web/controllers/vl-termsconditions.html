<h3>These are some terms and conditions</h3>

<p>Hopefully someone replaces these with something meaningful because at the moment you are agreeing to the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>To stop playing/purchasing monopoly and actually invest in some decent board games <i>(seriously, it's 2016)</i></li>
<li>To purchase each of the developers one item from either their Steam or Amazon wish lists</li>
<li>To stop putting beetroot on your hamburgers</li>
</ul>

<p>But of course noone will read this!</p>
